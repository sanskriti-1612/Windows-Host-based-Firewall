# Windows-Host-based-Firewall
Network-based next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) are an essential component of modern enterprise cybersecurity strategies. As the volume and sophistication of cyber-attacks increase, organizations require advanced security solutions that can provide comprehensive protection for their networks and applications. NGFWs are designed to address these needs by offering a range of advanced features, including deep packet inspection, application-level visibility, intrusion prevention, and VPN support. Overall, network-based NGFWs are a critical component of modern cybersecurity strategies. By providing advanced features such as deep packet inspection, application-level visibility, and real-time threat detection, NGFWs help organizations to secure their networks and protect against the ever-evolving threat landscape.
### Project Objectives -
1. Since firewalls are very expensive for small organizations and they find it very difficult to install them for security purposes, therefore our NGFW can help those organizations to perform security practices.

2. Creating an effective and affordable network firewall that incorporates packet filtering, logging, Network Address Translation(NAT), etc in its inventory.
### Methodology - 
When a user tries to navigate to a website, the browser sends the request to the proxy server, asking it to get the requested page on his behalf. The proxy establishes a new connection to the remote site and returns the response to the browser. The browser asks the proxy to establish a virtual tunnel between itself and the remote server and then sends encrypted data through the proxy. The domain name to which a virtual tunnel is being established is usually known, so a proxy can block this virtual tunnel when it finds out that the domain name belongs to a prohibited category. After an established trust browser can ask a proxy to connect to a remote site safely with HTTPS, the proxy can decrypt the traffic, filter it, encrypt it again and pass it to the browser. As the browser trusts the proxy it continues working with filtered HTTPS without any errors or warnings.
### Technologies Used - 
1. PyDivert (Python)
2. Wireshark
### Specifications - 
1. Packet filtering: A firewall must be able to examine each packet that enters or leaves the network and determine whether to allow it or block it based on a set of rules.

2. Access control: A firewall should be able to control which users or systems can access which resources on the network.

3. Port blocking: A firewall must be able to block specific ports used for certain services, such as file sharing or remote access.

4. Logging: A firewall should log all traffic passing through it, including the source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocol used.

5. Network address translation (NAT): A firewall can use NAT to allow multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address.

6. Denial-of-service (DoS) protection: A firewall can detect and prevent DoS attacks by blocking traffic from sources that are flooding the network with traffic.

7. Application-level filtering: A firewall can inspect traffic at the application level and block specific types of traffic, such as email attachments or web content.
### Conclusion - 
This project provides a comprehensive understanding of network firewall and its importance in network security. It is crucial for organizations to implement a network firewall as part of their network security strategy to protect against potential security threats and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their network resources. The project covers various aspects of network firewall, including its architecture, working, and methodologies for its construction, which provides the reader with a thorough understanding of network firewall and its role in network security.
